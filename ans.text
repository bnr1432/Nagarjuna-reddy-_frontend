Explain what the simple List Component does.

The Single List Item component, which is supplied the item's text and index inside the list, represents
each item in the list displayed by this React List Component. Along with onClickHandler, which manages the
list whenever an item in the list is clicked, we also pass isSelected, a boolean value that tells us
whether the SingleListItem is selected or not.Clicking on the SingleListItem component will select it. A
chosen item's backdrop colour switches from red to green.


What problems / warnings are there with code?

The problems/warnings with the code are:

Intital Value in useState hook: The setSelectedIndex useState hook is being called incorrectly. It should
be passed an initial value, but it is not.

Proper useState hook destruction: Additionally, the useState hook returns two values that are out of order
in the provided code: setSelectedIndex, a settter function that updates the state, and selectedIndex, the
current state. When destroying an array with the syntax [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex], the current
state (selectedIndex) should come before the function (setSelectedIndex).


isSelected prop: The isSelected prop of the SingleListItem component should be a boolean, but it is being
passed the selectedIndex state value, which is a number.

The items prop of the WrappedListComponent's propTypes declaration is wrong, and the shapeof property is
not present. PropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.shape(text: PropTypes.string.isRequired )) should be used instead.
